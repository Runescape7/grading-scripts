# This script returns a graded student assignment to their repository.
# It will leave the graded assignment in a new branch.
# The student will have to merge the changes into their master branch
# (or you have to issue a pull request, and maybe merge it depending on
# how much you want to do for the students.)

# This script will fetch a student assignment from Bitbucket for grading.
# The files are converted to a single PDF and put into the grading folder.
# Use the TestReturn.sh script to return the graded PDF to the students.

# The script takes a single parameter, which is the concatenation of all
# of the Bitbucket accounts of the students in the team, separated by a dashes.
# e.g. jsmith1-mjones
# It expects that the first username is the owner of the shared repository.

# This script returns a graded student assignment to their repository.
# It also copies the solution to their repository.
# It will leave the graded assignment in a new branch.
# The student will have to merge the changes into their master branch
# (or you have to issue a pull request, and maybe merge it depending on
# how much you want to do for the students.)

# The script takes two parameters

# Parameter 1 is the concatenation of all of the Bitbucket accounts of the students in the team, 
# separated by a dashes e.g. jsmith1-mjones
# It expects that the first username is the owner of the shared repository.

# Parameter 2 is name of the assignment e.g. Lab1

source "$(dirname "$0")/lib.sh"

cd $2 # folder for local repository

# checkout the student branch. if the branch does not exist, exit
git checkout $1 || exit 1

# copy the graded assignment to student repository. if wrong filename, exit
cp ../grading/$2/$1.pdf ./  || exit 1
# copy the solution to student repository. if wrong directory, remove graded file and exit
cp -r ../../../Labs/$2/$2'Solution' ./$2'Solution' || rm $1.pdf ; exit 1 

git add $1.pdf # add the graded assignment
git add $2'Solution' # add the solution

git commit -m"Returned graded $2 (and solution)" # commit the graded assignment
git push ${1%%-*} $1 # push the changes to student repository

git checkout master # return to the master branch
